    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a type of pastry, classically made with puff pastry dough
      so that it is light, flaky, and extremely buttery. Traditionally,
      croissants are formed into crescent shapes, which is probably where the
      name originated, since croissant means “crescent” in French. The pastries
      are extremely popular in France as well as in other nations, and are
      typically eaten with breakfast. In some cases, croissants may also be
      filled with sweet or savory ingredient, or used like bread to make
      croissant sandwiches.
